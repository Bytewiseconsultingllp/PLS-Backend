# Payment Status Enforcement - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **Problem Fixed**

Previously, freelancers could see ALL projects and bid on them, even if payment was pending. Milestones could also be created on unpaid projects. This creates business risk and workflow issues.

---

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **New Business Rule:**

> **Projects MUST have `paymentStatus = "SUCCEEDED"` before:**
>
> - Freelancers can see them
> - Freelancers can bid on them
> - Milestones can be created

---

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### 1. **Freelancer Project Listing** (`freelancerService.ts`)

#### getAvailableProjects()

```typescript
// BEFORE:
where: {
  deletedAt: null,
}

// AFTER:
where: {
  deletedAt: null,
  paymentStatus: "SUCCEEDED", // ✅ Only show paid projects
}
```

**Impact:**

- ✅ Freelancers only see projects with completed payments
- ✅ Project count reflects only paid projects
- ✅ Payment status included in response

---

### 2. **Project Details for Bidding** (`freelancerService.ts`)

#### getProjectForBidding()

```typescript
// BEFORE:
const project = await prisma.project.findUnique({
  where: {
    id: projectId,
    deletedAt: null,
  },
});

if (!project) {
  throw new Error("Project not found");
}

// AFTER:
const project = await prisma.project.findFirst({
  where: {
    id: projectId,
    deletedAt: null,
    paymentStatus: "SUCCEEDED", // ✅ Only show paid projects
  },
});

if (!project) {
  throw new Error("Project not found or payment not completed");
}
```

**Impact:**

- ✅ Freelancers cannot view unpaid project details
- ✅ Better error message indicating payment requirement
- ✅ Prevents circumventing the listing filter

---

### 3. **Bid Creation** (`freelancerService.ts`)

#### createBid()

```typescript
// Check if project exists
const project = await prisma.project.findUnique({
  where: { id: bidData.projectId },
});

if (!project) {
  throw new Error("Project not found");
}

// ✅ NEW: Check if payment is completed before allowing bids
if (project.paymentStatus !== "SUCCEEDED") {
  throw new Error(
    "Cannot bid on projects with pending payment. Payment must be completed first.",
  );
}
```

**Impact:**

- ✅ Freelancers cannot submit bids on unpaid projects
- ✅ Clear error message explaining why
- ✅ Prevents API workarounds

---

### 4. **Milestone Creation** (`newProjectController.ts`)

#### addMilestone()

```typescript
const project = await projectService.getProjectById(id);

if (!project) {
  throw { status: NOTFOUNDCODE, message: "Project not found" };
}

// ✅ NEW: Check if payment is completed before allowing milestone creation
if (project.paymentStatus !== "SUCCEEDED") {
  throw {
    status: BADREQUESTCODE,
    message:
      "Cannot create milestones for projects with pending payment. Payment must be completed first.",
  };
}
```

**Impact:**

- ✅ Clients/admins cannot create milestones on unpaid projects
- ✅ Enforces payment before project work begins
- ✅ Clear error message

---

## 📄 **Documentation Updated**

### 1. Freelancer Swagger (`freelancer.yaml`)

```yaml
description: |
  Retrieve a list of all available projects that freelancers can bid on.

  **Important:** 
  - Only projects with **SUCCEEDED payment status** are shown
  - Project pricing/estimates are intentionally hidden from freelancers
  - Projects with pending payments will not appear in this list
```

### 2. Milestone Swagger (`project-new.yaml`)

```yaml
description: |
  Add a new milestone to a specific project.

  **Payment Requirement:**
  - ⚠️ **Payment must be SUCCEEDED** before creating milestones
  - Projects with pending payments will be rejected
```

---

## 🔐 **Payment Status Enum**

From `prisma/schema.prisma`:

```prisma
enum PaymentStatus {
  PENDING    // ❌ Cannot bid, create milestones
  SUCCEEDED  // ✅ All actions allowed
  FAILED     // ❌ Cannot bid, create milestones
  CANCELED   // ❌ Cannot bid, create milestones
  REFUNDED   // ❌ Cannot bid, create milestones
}
```

---

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### Scenario 1: Freelancer Tries to View Projects

**Test:**

```bash
GET /api/v1/freelancer/projects
```

**Expected Result:**

- ✅ Only projects with `paymentStatus: "SUCCEEDED"` returned
- ❌ Projects with `paymentStatus: "PENDING"` NOT shown

---

### Scenario 2: Freelancer Tries to Bid on Unpaid Project

**Test:**

```bash
POST /api/v1/freelancer/bids
{
  "projectId": "unpaid-project-id",
  "bidAmount": 5000,
  "proposalText": "I can do this"
}
```

**Expected Result:**

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Cannot bid on projects with pending payment. Payment must be completed first."
}
```

---

### Scenario 3: Client Tries to Create Milestone on Unpaid Project

**Test:**

```bash
POST /api/v1/projects/{unpaid-project-id}/milestones
{
  "milestoneName": "Phase 1",
  "deadline": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
}
```

**Expected Result:**

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "status": 400,
  "message": "Cannot create milestones for projects with pending payment. Payment must be completed first."
}
```

---

### Scenario 4: After Payment Success

**Test:**

1. Complete payment → `paymentStatus = "SUCCEEDED"`
2. Try same actions above

**Expected Result:**

- ✅ Project appears in freelancer listings
- ✅ Freelancers can bid
- ✅ Milestones can be created

---

## 📊 **Workflow**

```
1. Client creates project
   ├─→ paymentStatus = "PENDING"
   ├─→ ❌ NOT visible to freelancers
   ├─→ ❌ Cannot receive bids
   └─→ ❌ Cannot create milestones
   ↓
2. Client completes payment
   ├─→ paymentStatus = "SUCCEEDED" ✅
   ├─→ ✅ Visible to freelancers
   ├─→ ✅ Can receive bids
   └─→ ✅ Can create milestones
   ↓
3. Freelancers bid on project
   ↓
4. Admin reviews bids
   ↓
5. Freelancers work on milestones
```

---

## ✅ **Files Modified**

1. ✅ `src/services/freelancerService.ts`

   - Updated `getAvailableProjects()` - filter by payment status
   - Updated `getProjectForBidding()` - check payment status
   - Updated `createBid()` - validate payment status before bid

3. ✅ `src/swagger/freelancer.yaml`

---

## 🎯 **Benefits**

2. ✅ **Clear Workflow**: Payment → Visibility → Bidding → Work
3. ✅ **Freelancer Protection**: Only see legitimate paid projects
4. ✅ **Client Clarity**: Understand payment is required first
5. ✅ **Business Logic Enforcement**: Automated, not manual
6. ✅ **API Security**: Multiple layers of validation

---

## 🚀 **Status: COMPLETE!**

All payment status checks are now in place:

- ✅ Project listing filtered by payment status
