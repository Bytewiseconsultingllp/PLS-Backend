2. Technical project requirements
3. Communication channel (Discord)
4. Project timeline and scope

### ‚úÖ **Benefits:**

1. **Client Privacy:** Prevents unsolicited contact from freelancers
2. **Professional Boundaries:** Communication happens through platform channels

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility

- ‚úÖ **API Structure:** No changes to endpoint URLs or request formats
- ‚úÖ **Response Schema:** Structure remains same, just fewer fields in `details`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Frontend Impact:** Frontend code accessing `details.fullName`, `details.businessEmail`, or `details.phoneNumber` will now receive `undefined`

### Frontend Updates Needed

If frontend code was using:

```typescript
// ‚ùå These will now be undefined
project.details.fullName;
project.details.businessEmail;
project.details.phoneNumber;
```

Replace with:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Use these instead
project.details.companyName;
project.discordChatUrl; // For communication
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:

1. Add anonymized client identifier (e.g., "Client #12345")
2. Add in-app messaging system (alternative to Discord)
3. Add moderator-mediated introductions
4. Track freelancer-client interactions
5. Add client consent for revealing contact info (after project acceptance)
