# Payment Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Schema Updates

- ‚úÖ Added `paymentStatus` field to `Project` model

  - `handleCheckoutSessionCompleted` - Updates project status to SUCCEEDED
  - `handleCheckoutSessionExpired` - Updates project status to CANCELED

### 6. Updated Routers

  - Added `/project/create-checkout-session` endpoint
  - Added `/project/:projectId/status` endpoint

### 7. Documentation Created

- ‚úÖ **PAYMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** (this file)

## üìã New API Endpoints

### 1. Create Project Checkout Session

```
POST /api/v1/payments/project/create-checkout-session
Authorization: Bearer <token>

Body:
{
  "projectId": "string",
  "successUrl": "string",
  "cancelUrl": "string",
  "currency": "string" (optional, default: "usd")
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "sessionId": "string",
    "checkoutUrl": "string",
    "paymentId": "string"
  }
}
```

### 2. Get Project Payment Status

```
GET /api/v1/payments/project/:projectId/status
Authorization: Bearer <token>

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "paymentStatus": "PENDING|SUCCEEDED|FAILED|CANCELED|REFUNDED",
    "payments": [...]
  }
}
```

## üîÑ Payment Flow

```
1. Visitor fills details
   ‚Üì
2. Visitor registers as user
   ‚Üì
3. User verifies OTP
   ‚Üì
4. Project auto-created (paymentStatus: PENDING)
   ‚Üì
5. Frontend calls: POST /payments/project/create-checkout-session
   ‚Üì
6. User redirected to Stripe Checkout (checkoutUrl)
   ‚Üì
7. User completes payment
   ‚Üì
8. Stripe sends webhook: checkout.session.completed
   ‚Üì
9. Backend updates project (paymentStatus: SUCCEEDED)
   ‚Üì
10. User redirected to successUrl
```

## üí∞ Amount Handling

- **Source:** `ProjectEstimate.calculatedTotal`
- **Storage:** Decimal in dollars (e.g., 100.50)
- **Conversion:** Multiplied by 100 for Stripe (e.g., 10050 cents)
- **Validation:** Amount must be > 0

## üîê Security Features

‚úÖ Authentication required for all payment endpoints  
‚úÖ Authorization checks (user must own project)  
‚úÖ Webhook signature verification  
‚úÖ Amount retrieved from server (not client)  
‚úÖ Project/User/Visitor IDs stored in Stripe metadata  
‚úÖ Payment status can't be manually set (only via webhooks)

## üìù Database Changes Required

**IMPORTANT:** Run this command before testing:

```bash
cd /Users/ssingh83/Desktop/MONDAYTARGET/PLS-Backend
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_payment_status_to_project
```

Or in production:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Prerequisites

- [ ] Database running
- [ ] Stripe test keys in `.env`
- [ ] Stripe CLI installed
- [ ] Migration applied

### Test Steps

- [ ] Start Stripe webhook listener
- [ ] Create visitor with complete details
- [ ] Register user
- [ ] Verify OTP (project auto-created)
- [ ] Get project ID
- [ ] Create checkout session
- [ ] Complete payment with test card (4242 4242 4242 4242)
- [ ] Verify webhook received
- [ ] Check project paymentStatus = "SUCCEEDED"
- [ ] Test payment status endpoint

### Error Scenarios

- [ ] Try to pay for non-existent project (404)
- [ ] Try to pay for another user's project (403)
- [ ] Try to pay for already-paid project (400)
- [ ] Test with declined card (4000 0000 0000 0002)
- [ ] Test webhook with invalid signature

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

### Development

- [ ] Apply database migration
- [ ] Set up Stripe CLI for webhooks
- [ ] Test complete flow
- [ ] Verify logs

### Production

- [ ] Apply migration to production DB
- [ ] Set up production webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` with production secret
- [ ] Configure success/cancel URLs
- [ ] Set up monitoring for payment failures
- [ ] Test with small real payment
- [ ] Monitor logs for first few transactions

## üîß Configuration Required

### Environment Variables

```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...  # Production
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...  # Production webhook secret
```

### Stripe Dashboard Setup

1. Go to Developers ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/payments/webhook`
3. Select events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `checkout.session.expired`
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
4. Copy signing secret to `.env`

## üìä Monitoring Points

Monitor these metrics:

- Payment success rate
- Average payment amount
- Payment failures (by reason)
- Webhook delivery failures
- Time to payment completion
- Projects with pending payments > 24 hours

Log queries:

```sql
-- Projects pending payment
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Project" WHERE "paymentStatus" = 'PENDING';

-- Successful payments today
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Payment"
WHERE status = 'SUCCEEDED'
AND DATE("paidAt") = CURRENT_DATE;

-- Failed payments
SELECT * FROM "Payment"
WHERE status = 'FAILED'
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Manual Migration:** Database migration must be run manually due to non-interactive environment
2. **Single Currency:** Currently supports USD by default (can be changed per request)
3. **No Partial Payments:** Full payment required upfront
4. **No Installments:** No support for payment plans yet
5. **No Refund UI:** Refunds must be processed via Stripe Dashboard or API

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- [ ] Support multiple currencies
- [ ] Payment plans/installments
- [ ] Partial payment support
- [ ] Refund management UI
- [ ] Payment retry mechanism
- [ ] Email notifications for payment events
- [ ] Payment receipt generation
- [ ] Invoice generation
- [ ] Payment analytics dashboard
- [ ] Subscription support for recurring projects

## üÜò Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Migration fails with index error
**Solution:** This is a pre-existing database issue. Contact DBA or fix indexes manually.

**Issue:** Webhook not received
**Solution:** Check Stripe CLI is running and webhook secret is correct.

**Issue:** Amount is $0.00
**Solution:** Ensure estimate is calculated and `calculatedTotal` has a value.

**Issue:** Project not found after registration
**Solution:** Verify visitor accepted estimate and signed service agreement.

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check if migration is needed
npx prisma migrate status

# View payment logs
tail -f logs/application-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log | grep -i payment

# Test webhook locally
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed

# Verify Stripe configuration
stripe config --list
```

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria Met

‚úÖ Project has `paymentStatus` field  
‚úÖ Payment initiated after project creation  
‚úÖ Amount from `ProjectEstimate.calculatedTotal`  
‚úÖ Checkout Session used (Stripe hosted page)  
‚úÖ Redirect URLs passed in API body  
‚úÖ Webhooks update project status  
‚úÖ PENDING status on project creation  
‚úÖ SUCCEEDED status after payment  
‚úÖ FAILED/CANCELED status on failure

## üìù Notes

- The project is created **before** payment to ensure data integrity
- Payment failure doesn't delete the project (can retry payment)
- All payment operations are logged for audit trails
- Webhook signature verification prevents fraudulent status updates
- Amount calculation is server-side only (client can't manipulate)

## üéâ Implementation Complete!

The payment integration is **READY FOR TESTING**.

**Next Step:** Run the database migration and follow the testing guide.
