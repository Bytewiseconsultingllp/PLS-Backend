# KPI SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION - COMPLETE SUMMARY

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive KPI (Key Performance Indicator) points and ranking system for freelancers. The system allows Admin, Moderators, and Clients to reward or penalize freelancers with points, which automatically determine their rank category.

---

## 📊 KPI Rank Categories

| Category      | Points Required    |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| **BRONZE**    | < 50 points        |
| **SILVER**    | 50 - 199 points    |
| **GOLD**      | 200 - 499 points   |
| **PLATINIUM** | 500 - 999 points   |
| **DIAMOND**   | 1000 - 1999 points |
| **CROWN**     | 2000 - 4999 points |
| **ACE**       | 5000 - 9999 points |
| **CONQUERER** | 10,000+ points     |

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. **Database Schema** (Already Existed)

The schema already had all necessary fields in the `User` model:

- `kpiRankPoints` (Int): Current total points
- `kpiRank` (KPIRANK): Current rank category
- `kpiHistory` (Json[]): History of all point changes
- `kpi` (Json[]): Additional KPI data

### 2. **Service Layer** (`src/services/kpiService.ts`)

Created comprehensive service with the following functions:

#### Core Functions:

- **`assignKPIPoints(freelancerId, data)`**: Assign points to a freelancer

  - Supports positive (reward) and negative (penalty) points
  - Automatically calculates new rank
  - Stores history entry with metadata
  - Returns updated KPI data

- **`getFreelancerKPI(freelancerId)`**: Get current KPI for a freelancer

- **`getKPIHistory(freelancerId, limit)`**: Get detailed history of point changes

- **`getKPILeaderboard(page, limit)`**: Get top freelancers by points

  - Paginated
  - Only shows active, accepted freelancers
  - Sorted by points (descending)

- **`canAssignKPIPoints(userId, userRole, freelancerId, projectId)`**: Authorization helper

  - Admin: Can assign to anyone
  - Moderator: Can only assign to freelancers on their assigned projects
  - Client: Can only assign to freelancers working on their projects

- **`calculateKPIRank(points)`**: Utility to calculate rank from points

### 3. **Controller Layer** (`src/controllers/kpiController/kpiController.ts`)

Created separate controllers for different roles:

- **`assignKPIPointsAdmin`**: Admin assigns points (any freelancer)
- **`assignKPIPointsModerator`**: Moderator assigns points (assigned projects only)
- **`assignKPIPointsClient`**: Client assigns points (their projects only)
- **`getFreelancerKPI`**: View KPI data
- **`getKPIHistory`**: View KPI history (authenticated)
- **`getKPILeaderboard`**: View leaderboard (public)

### 4. **Routing** (`src/routers/kpiRouter/kpiRouter.ts`)

Organized routes by role and access:

#### Admin Routes:

```
POST /api/v1/admin/freelancers/:freelancerId/kpi
```

#### Moderator Routes:

```
POST /api/v1/moderator-kpi/freelancers/:freelancerId/kpi
```

#### Client Routes:

```
POST /api/v1/client-kpi/freelancers/:freelancerId/kpi
```

#### Public/Authenticated Routes:

```
GET /api/v1/freelancers/leaderboard
GET /api/v1/freelancers/:freelancerId/kpi
GET /api/v1/freelancers/:freelancerId/kpi-history (authenticated)
```

### 5. **Validation** (`src/validation/zod.ts`)

Created `assignKPIPointsSchema`:

- `points`: Integer, cannot be zero
- `note`: String, 5-500 characters, explains reason
- `projectId`: Optional UUID (required for Moderator/Client)

### 6. **Integration Updates**

#### Updated `src/services/freelancerService.ts`:

Added KPI data to all freelancer listings:

- `getBidById()`: Includes freelancer's KPI in bid details
- `getBidsForProject()`: Shows KPI for all bidding freelancers
- `getAllFreelancers()`: Admin list shows KPI for each freelancer

Now when bids are viewed, KPI data is automatically included:

```json
{
  "freelancer": {
    "id": "...",
    "details": {...},
    "user": {
      "uid": "...",
      "username": "...",
      "fullName": "...",
      "kpiRankPoints": 150,
      "kpiRank": "SILVER"
    }
  }
}
```

### 7. **Swagger Documentation** (`src/swagger/kpi.yaml`)

Comprehensive API documentation with:

- All endpoints documented
- Examples for rewards, penalties, and bonuses
- Clear authorization requirements
- KPI category explanations
- Sample request/response payloads

### 8. **Swagger Config** (`src/config/swagger.ts`)

Added new tags:

- `KPI - Admin`
- `KPI - Moderator`
- `KPI - Client`
- `KPI - Public`

## 📍 Visibility in System

### **Freelancer Bid Listings**

When clients/admin view bids on a project, they now see:

- Freelancer's current KPI points
- Freelancer's current rank (BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD, etc.)

This helps in decision-making during freelancer selection.

### **Leaderboard**

Public leaderboard shows:

- Top freelancers by KPI points
- Current rank for each freelancer
- Pagination support

### **Individual KPI View**

Anyone can view a freelancer's:

- Current points
- Current rank

Authenticated users can view:

- Full KPI history (who gave points, when, why)
